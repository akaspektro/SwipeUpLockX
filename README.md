# SwipeUpLockX

This library is for iPhone X ONLY. 

Usage in other device models might produce undesired behavior and might not work as it surely does in the X. Use it at your own risk.

It lets you lock the device using the swipe up from bottom screen gesture instead of the lock button (The phone is hella expensive so why not save your physical buttons?).

It now includes a preference bundle to make it work only in SpringBoard' main page or everywhere when there's no open app.

You know how it is, any executable file must be 0755 permission, others might be 0644...

Tested in an iPhone X running iOS 11.1.2 with Electra jailbreak.
