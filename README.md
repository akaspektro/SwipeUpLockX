# SwipeUpLockX

This library is for iPhone X ONLY.

It lets you lock the device using the swipe up gesture instead of the lock button.
It will lock your device only when there's no open app.

You know how it is, put those files in /usr/lib/SBInject, dylib with 0755 permission and plist with 0644 permission, respring and there you go...

Tested in an iPhone X running iOS 11.1.2 with Electra jailbreak.
